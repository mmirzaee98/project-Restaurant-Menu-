# Restaurant Menu Manager

This is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), using the App Router. It allows restaurant staff to manage menu items — including creating new dishes, editing existing ones, and deleting entries — while customers can browse the menu from a public view.

The backend is powered by `json-server`, simulating a RESTful API using a local `db.json` file.
